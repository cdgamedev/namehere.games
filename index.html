                        Welcome to the planet of Holmfen, home to the ditzy, newt-like gruttels!
                        <br><br>
                        Interact with and manage a colony of gruttels as they clean their rubbish-filled home. Select which gruttels you will bring on your cleaning excursions. Feed them Nana Betsy ready meals to power them up, throughout the level. Direct the geruttels to the rubbish and back to their recycling machines, snapping them out of any distractions. Be careful as when the rubbish starts to pile up, so do the gruttels' stress levels! Manage their stress until the timer runs out the successfully clean Holmfen!
                        <br><br>
                        Gruttel Scuttle is a fast-paced strategy management game, proudly produced by Trojan Mouse, a dedicated team of second-year game development students. We hope you fall in love with the little gruttels as much as we have! Enjoy the game and happy cleaning!
